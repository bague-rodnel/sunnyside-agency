## My process

This was coded with Bootstrap 5.1.3. Only the necessary compiled css files have been linked to. The js is fetched via cdn.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I felt like this took longer than expected considering I was using Bootstrap. I'm going to redo this with pure css for a change in another branch
